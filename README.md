Sign Language Detection Model ðŸ¤Ÿ
This project is a real-time sign language detection system that recognizes alphabets using live video capture. It leverages advanced techniques in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to enable efficient and accurate detection.

Features
Real-time Alphabet Detection: Detects and displays corresponding alphabets in real-time using live video input.
Custom Dataset: Dataset created from scratch using hand images captured via a camera, ensuring diversity and robustness.
Deep Learning Architecture: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for high accuracy in classification.
OpenCV Integration: Implements real-time video capture and processing.
Comprehensive Workflow: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and real-time testing.
Tools & Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Additional modules as required
How It Works
Dataset Creation:

Images of hands forming alphabets were captured and labeled manually.
These images were preprocessed and organized into a structured dataset.
Model Training:

A deep learning model was trained using the custom dataset.
Techniques like data augmentation and optimization were applied to enhance performance.
Real-time Detection:

The trained model is integrated with OpenCV for live video processing.
The system predicts and overlays the detected alphabet on the video feed in real-time.
